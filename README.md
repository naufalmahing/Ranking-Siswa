# Ranking-Siswa
This is from my second term OOP Project where I create a program to sort students that's in the database.
# Note
You can immediately run this program and it will automatically make a database from notepad, so you can exit this program without worrying that you will have to input the data again in the program.
# How to run
Just download projekakhir1 folder and build it into a project so you can run the folder as a package and run Main.java.
